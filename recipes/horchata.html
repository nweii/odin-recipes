	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>Horchata, a sweet cinnamon drink popular throughout Latin America, is typically made by soaking white rice in water, straining through a fine-mesh sieve to eliminate solids, if desired, then sweetening the liquid with sugar and cinnamon. But the horchata at Guisados, a chain of taco restaurants in Los Angeles, is different. It's made with whole milk and is served plain, or “dirty” with a shot of cold brew concentrate — and the chain sells up to 700 a day. This is an adaptation of its caffeinated version, and it serves a crowd. (You can leave out the coffee or halve the recipe, if you like.) Enjoy it with something spicy on a hot summer’s day.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>2</b> <b>cups</b> uncooked long-grain white rice</li>
		<li><b>1</b> (<b>14</b>-<b>ounce</b>) <b>can</b> sweetened condensed milk</li>
		<li><b>1</b> <b>tablespoon</b> ground nutmeg</li>
		<li><b>1</b> <b>tablespoon</b> ground cinnamon</li>
		<li><b><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></b> <b>gallon</b> whole milk</li>
		<li><b>2</b> <b>cups</b> cold brew concentrate or espresso, for serving</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Add the rice and 2 1/2 cups water to a large container and cover. Soak at room temperature for a minimum of 8 hours.</li>
		<li>Pour the rice and soaking liquid into a blender, and blend until all the rice is finely ground, 2 to 3 minutes. (If necessary, stop your blender periodically to prevent overheating.) Add condensed milk, nutmeg and cinnamon; blend until combined. Pour the mixture into a large pitcher or bowl. Add the whole milk and whisk until incorporated.</li>
		<li>To serve, divide horchata among ice-filled glasses and top with cold brew concentrate, to taste (about 2 to 3 tablespoons cold brew for each cup of horchata).</li>
	</ol>
