	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>This Korean savory porridge was originally created as a comforting meal to soothe an upset stomach, but it’s satisfying no matter how you feel. A stovetop version typically requires a few hours to prepare, but the process is reduced to a mere 30 minutes with the use of a pressure cooker, and boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which cook faster than a whole chicken. In the cooker, combine the chicken, rice, vegetables and store-bought chicken broth with aromatics, and your work is done. The chicken emerges meltingly tender and practically shreds itself. A fresh and vibrant ginger sauce brightens the rich, warming soup.</p>
	<h2>Ingredients</h2>
	<ul>
		<li><b>1</b> <b>cup</b> short-grain white rice (about 7 1/2 ounces), rinsed until water runs clear
		<li><b>3</b> <b>ounces</b> white button mushrooms, very thinly sliced (<i>about 1 packed cup</i>)</li>
		<li><b>1</b> small carrot, peeled and chopped into 1/4-inch pieces (<i>about 1/2 cup</i>)</li>
		<li><b>1</b> garlic clove, minced</li>
		<li><b><sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>4</sub></b> <b>teaspoon</b> toasted sesame oil</li>
		<li><b>6</b> <b>cups</b> low-sodium chicken broth</li>
		<li><b>1</b> (<b>2</b>-inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and julienned</li>
		<li><b>1 <sup>1</sup>⁄<sub>2</sub></b> <b>pounds</b> boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
		<li><b>2</b> scallions, trimmed and finely chopped (<i>about 1/3 cup</i>)</li>
		<li><b>3</b> <b>tablespoons</b> safflower or canola oil</li>
		<li><b>2</b> <b>tablespoons</b> white vinegar</li>
		<li>Kosher salt and black pepper</li>
		<li><b>2</b> <b>ounces</b> baby spinach (<i>about 2 cups</i>)</li>
		<li>Any combination of soy sauce, chile oil and hot sauce, for serving</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Steps</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>In a pressure cooker, combine rice, mushrooms, carrot, garlic, sesame oil, broth and half the ginger. Mix well. Add chicken, taking care to submerge the thighs in the liquid. Lock pressure cooker lid in place and set steam vent to sealing position. Select manual pressure cook and cook for 20 minutes on high pressure. Let pressure release naturally or manually release. (Be careful: It may splatter, so manually release gradually. A kitchen towel can be placed over the knob to catch any liquid.) Transfer chicken to a cutting board and shred.</li>
		<li>While the juk cooks, prepare the scallion sauce: In a small bowl, combine scallions, safflower oil, vinegar and the remaining ginger. Season with salt and pepper, and mix well.</li>
		<li>Stir the spinach and half the chicken into the cooked juk. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
		<li>Divide juk among bowls. Top each with some of the remaining chicken and drizzle with the scallion sauce. Serve with soy sauce and chile oil or hot sauce on the side, if desired.</li>
	</ol>
