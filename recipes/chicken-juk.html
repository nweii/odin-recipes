	<p>This Korean savory porridge was originally created as a comforting meal to soothe an upset stomach, but itâ€™s satisfying no matter how you feel. A stovetop version typically requires a few hours to prepare, but the process is reduced to a mere 30 minutes with the use of a pressure cooker, and boneless, skinless chicken thighs, which cook faster than a whole chicken. In the cooker, combine the chicken, rice, vegetables and store-bought chicken broth with aromatics, and your work is done. The chicken emerges meltingly tender and practically shreds itself. A fresh and vibrant ginger sauce brightens the rich, warming soup.</p>
